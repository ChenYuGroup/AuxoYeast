# Description
An improvement for Yeast9 based on nutrient auxotrophy analysis. We introduce a straightforward function designed to operate seamlessly with the consensus genome-scale metabolic model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. This function is consistent with the yeast9 requirement, empowering users to swiftly implement the curated improvements.

# Required software
Matlab (The function is implemented in the matlab)
Gurobi Optimizer (The solution procedure is performed using Gurobi)
COBRA toolbox (https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox)

# About our study
Our study presents a upgrade to Yeast9 that significantly bolsters its ability to predict auxotrophic phenotypes accurately. By meticulously curating the model through a rigorous examination of nutrient deficiencies, we have bridged the gap between experimental observations and in silico predictions, thereby refining Yeast9 into a more robust tool for metabolic engineering and systems biology applications.
